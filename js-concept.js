// Everything in javascript happens inside execution context

// Execution context is a big box, where we are storing the variable and function or we can called them as Variable Envirnment.

//In this varibale envirnmnet all the values and funciotns are store in key value pair.




// The 2nd component of the executiuon conetent is the code component.
//So this is componet where the code executed one at a time.
//This is also callaed as thread of execution.
//This is like thread of execution where code executed one at a time.

// So finally we got to know that Javascript is single threaded synchronoius language.

// So that means JS can execute one line at a time and in specific order.

// This means it will go to next line once the current line executed.
